#PDF_Merger

## What is this project about?

I didn't like not being able to merge .PDFs without spending money or uploading my files to some 3rd party website.I solved this by creating a simple open source windows application to do just *that*. I'm using iTextSharp and WPF.

## How do I install it?

Run the .exe inside the "Release" folder.

## Misc

If you found a bug, or want to improve the program by all means play with the code (or message me)!
