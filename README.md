# PDF_Merger

## What is this project about?

I didn't like not being able to merge .PDFs without spending money or uploading my files to some 3rd party website.I solved this by creating a simple open source windows application to do just *that*.

## How do I install it?

You can just download the .exe and the program should work flawlessly.

## How do I use it?

Once you open the program you are met with a simple interface.On the left panel you can find instructions but also the main buttons. You first add the .PDFs you want to merge *in the order you want them to merge in*. After that you just press the "Merge!" button and select a name for the final .PDF as well as the save location. 

You can select to either open the file/directory you saved the file from the checkboxes on the bottom left, and can choose to *not* include a file by double-clicking on it.

## Misc

If you found a bug, or want to improve the program by all means play with the code (or message me)!
